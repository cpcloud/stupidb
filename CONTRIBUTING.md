# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/cpcloud/stupidb/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

stupidb could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official
stupidb docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and
such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/cpcloud/stupidb/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `stupidb` for local development.

1. Fork the `stupidb` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/stupidb.git
```

3. [Install nix](https://nixos.org/guides/install-nix.html)
4. Enable the `stupidb` [`cachix`](https://cachix.org) cache:

```sh
$ nix run nixpkgs.cachix -c cachix use stupidb
```

This step is optional but **highly recommended**.

Without the `stupidb` cache, most dependencies will be built from source and it
will take a very long time to setup your development environment.

5. Enter a `nix-shell`:

```sh
$ cd stupidb/
$ nix-shell -A python39
```

This will take a bit of time, but should be relatively quick if you
enabled the `stupidb` cachix cache.

6. Create a branch for local development:

```sh
$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass formatting
   checks and tests:

```sh
$ nix-shell -A python39 --pure --run 'pre-commit run --all-files'
```

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```sh
$ git add .
$ git cz
$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

9. Submit a pull request using the [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) CLI tool or
   through the GitHub web UI.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your
   new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3. The pull request should work for Pythons 3.7-3.9. Check
   https://github.com/cpcloud/stupidb/actions and make sure that the tests
   pass.

## Releasing

Releases are fully automated using [semantic
release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release) conventions.

> **âš  WARNING**
> Releasing by hand is intentionally not documented. Do not release anything by hand.

1. Releases are cut for every commit as determined by [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io).
2. `CHANGELOG.md` is automatically updated with new changes by the
   [python-semantic-release GitHub action](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automatic-releases/github-actions.html).
3. Versions are bumped in the necessary places automatically.
4. Docs are updated at https://readthedocs.org/projects/stupidb on every commit
   regardless of whether a release is cut.
