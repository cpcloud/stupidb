Are you tired of software that's too smart? Try StupiDB, the stupidest database
you'll ever come across.

StupiDB was built to understand how a relational database might be implemented.

RDBMSs like PostgreSQL are extremely complex. It was hard for to me to imagine
what implementing the core of a relational database like PostgreSQL would look
like just by tinkering with and reading the source code, so I decided to write
my own.
