Are you tired of software that's too smart? Try StupiDB, the stupidest database
you'll ever come across.

StupiDB was built to understand how a relational database might be implemented.

Systems like PostgreSQL are extremely complex. It was hard for to me to imagine
what implementing the core of a relational database like PostgreSQL would look
like just by tinkering with and reading the source code, so I decided to write
my own.

* Stupid window functions

* Sophomoric group bys
* Idiotic user defined aggregates, including custom dumb window aggregates
* Scales down, not up

Non-Features

* Stupid simple in-memory format
* Stupidly easy to read codebase
